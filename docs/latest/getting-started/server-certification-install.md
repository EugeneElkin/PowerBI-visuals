# HTTPS Certificate Setup

To access your visual through PowerBI, you need to add a trusted certificate for localhost. This will allow PowerBI to load the visual assets in your browser without a security warning.

## Adding Certificate

* [Windows](CertificateAddWindows.md)
* [OSX](CertificateAddOSX.md)

## Removing Certificate

If you are no longer using the PowerBI Custom Visual CLI tools, you should remove the certificate from your system.

* [Windows](CertificateRemoveWindows.md)
* [OSX](CertificateRemoveOSX.md)

## Enable developer visual
To view/test your visual in PowerBI you need to enable the development visual and then you can add it to any report.
